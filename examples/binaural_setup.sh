# Example of binaural source localization.  Generates 30-degree increments in azimuthal plane
# Author: Scott Hawley
#
# Requirements: sox  (SOund eXchange).
#
# NOTES:
#    1. The call to augment & binauralify will process ANY .wav files sitting in the binaural/ directory.
#       Thus if you want to add more test signals, create binaural/ first and add your signals,
#       then run this script
#    2. We split the signals into clips first, THEN augment, rather than augmenting first.  This gives our
#       data better "granularity" and makes it so the Test dataset won't (or is very unlikely to) contain
#       "exact" copies of what's in the Train dataset
#
# TODO: Need checks to see if commands succeed
